  <h2>My Journey</h2>
  <p>
    Over the past few semesters, I’ve explored full stack development, AI integration, and blockchain-based apps through real project work. Whether it's developing an e-learning app or working on drug discovery using AI, I love learning by doing.

  <h2>Where I’m Headed</h2>
  <p>
    I'm constantly looking for ways to grow — whether it’s improving my frontend skills, exploring backend logic, or contributing to real-world solutions. My next goal is to deepen my skills in cloud deployment and real-time data integration.
